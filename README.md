book-tools
==========

Product of following Jim Wilson's "Node.js The Right Way" while making some drastic changes to the client-side MVC.
As Jim's book was written before Express moved away from the Connect project, a lot of the structure has been changed and rearranged as I saw fit. This project does not use handlebar.js for templating, instead it uses Jade engine in the second segment of the webapp. The webapp does not include search by subject and the search by author API was written but never implemented in the project.

Will include database implementation shortly.
